# Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). The game features a dark mode theme and allows the agent to continuously learn and improve its strategy during gameplay. Built with Pygame for the interface and TensorFlow for the neural network.

## Features

- Dark mode theme
- Reinforcement learning agent using DQN
- Continuous learning and strategy improvement
- Pygame interface
- TensorFlow neural network

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/raouf-kri/tic-tac-toe_DQN
    cd tic-tac-toe_DQN
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the agent:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Tic-Tac-Toe_RL.ipynb
    ```

2. Execute the cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the agent.

3. To play the game, run the main script:
    ```sh
    python Tic-Tac-Toe_RL.ipynb
    ```
